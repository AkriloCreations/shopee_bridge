"""Frappe hooks for Shopee Bridge.

Keep this file minimal: only declarative metadata & schedules.
Avoid importing heavy modules (frappe / services) here to keep
bench start & migrate fast.

Future additions:
 - Add `fixtures` only if specific Custom Fields must be shipped.
 - Add `doc_events` when enabling document-level reactions.
 - Add `desktop_icons` / `app_include_js` when UI assets exist.
