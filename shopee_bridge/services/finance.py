"""Finance / escrow / reconciliation service layer.

Responsibilities (future full implementation):
 - Pull escrow detail for completed Shopee orders.
 - Patch related Sales Invoice with Shopee fee breakout.
 - Create Bank Transaction (or Journal Entry) representing Shopee payout.
 - Reconcile payouts strictly and perform historical backfills.

Current state: SAFE STUBS (no DB mutations) returning deterministic mock
identifiers so upstream jobs can be wired without side effects.

Domain notes / design contracts:
 1. Sales Invoice fee line: one negative row with item/name "Total Fee Shopee".
	If exists, update amounts instead of adding duplicates (idempotent).
 2. Custom fields expected on Sales Invoice (not yet created here):
	   - escrow_synced (Check)
	   - escrow_synced_at (Datetime)
	   - escrow_fee_total (Currency)
	   - escrow_net (Currency)
	   - payout_batch_id (Data)
	These allow detecting previous sync & preventing regressions.
 3. Idempotency heuristics:
	   - Fee patch keyed by (order_sn, payout_batch_id).
	   - Bank transaction creation keyed by (reference_number, deposit_amount).
 4. Reconciliation rule (strict): match bank transaction whose amount == escrow net
	   AND value date within tolerance (same day). If amount matches but date differs,
	   policy: adjust date or flag for manual review (TODO â€“ decision pending).
 5. Backfill strategy: iterate orders (by completion date) in date range, pulling
	   escrow details and applying the same patch/create routines.

Endpoints used:
 - /api/v2/payment/get_escrow_detail (only external call in this stub set)

All other functions are placeholders with docstrings describing planned behavior.
